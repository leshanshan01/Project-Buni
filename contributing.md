# Contributing to Project Buni ⚡

First off, thank you for being part of this cohort! By contributing to Project Buni, you are helping build the Bitcoin developer ecosystem in Kenya. 

## 🛣️ The Workflow
We follow a standard Open Source workflow. Even if you are new to Git, these steps will help you stay aligned with the team:

### 1. Find an Issue
Before starting work, check the "Issues" tab on GitHub. During the training phase, these might be research tasks or documentation. Later, they will be specific features or bugs.

### 2. Branching Strategy
Please do not push directly to the `main` branch. 
* Create a new branch for your work: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `git checkout -b fix/issue-name`.

### 3. Commit Messages
Be clear and concise. 
* Good: `feat: add lightning invoice generation logic`
* Bad: `fixed stuff`

### 4. Pull Requests (PRs)
Once your work is ready:
* Push your branch to GitHub.
* Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch.
* Describe what you changed and why.
* Tag a Technical Lead (Martin or Yankho) for review.

## 🎓 Learning by Building
If you are stuck on a technical implementation related to **Nostr, Lightning, or Cashu**, don't hesitate to:
1. Ask in the WhatsApp/Telegram dev group.
2. Tag a mentor in your PR comments.
3. Reference the documentation in the `/docs` folder.

## ⚖️ License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the **MIT License** (or the license chosen in the LICENSE file).
